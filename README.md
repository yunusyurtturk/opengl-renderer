OpenGL Renderer.

This repo serves as a practice space and playground for my personal exploration.

Although I am already familiar with many of the concepts involved, my experience is primarily based on using existing frameworks such as game engines and other graphics-related software. Here, I aim to develop a project entirely from scratch..


* 3D coordinate
* Perspective camera/projection
* Culling
* Model/Mesh rendering
* Multiple mesh rendering
* Different type of meshes (not limited to cube!)
* Textures
* Mesh loading
* Multiple light sources
* etc.
